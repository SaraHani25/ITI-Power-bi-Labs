## ðŸ§© Key Concepts Applied Across All Projects  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Fixed missing or inconsistent values.  
- Corrected data types and standardized date/time formats.  
- Created calculated columns and conditional logic in Power Query.  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling  
- Built **Star Schemas** linking Fact and Dimension tables.  
- Created supporting tables such as:  
  - **Date Table** (using DAX or Power Query)  
  - **Status / Time Tables** for classification and time-based grouping.  

### ðŸ”¹ DAX & KPIs  
- Built measures for key performance indicators, including:  
  - **Total Sales, Total Revenue, Tax, Freight, Growth %, Delay %, Occupancy Rate**  
- Used advanced DAX for **Year-over-Year (YoY)** and **Time Intelligence** analysis.  

### ðŸ”¹ Visualization Techniques  
- **Line & Area Charts** â†’ Trend and time-series analysis.  
- **Bar & Column Charts** â†’ Comparisons and category breakdowns.  
- **Pie & Donut Charts** â†’ Distribution of categories.  
- **Maps** â†’ Geographic performance and delay analysis.  
- **Decomposition Tree** â†’ Root cause exploration.  
- **Cards & KPIs** â†’ Highlighting key metrics clearly.
